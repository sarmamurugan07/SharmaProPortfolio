            <h2>üåÆ Work History</h2>

            <h3>Junior Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                Led the development of TSOffice, a large-scale web application serving multiple organizations with
                comprehensive solutions for employee administration, asset management, project permissions, and more.
                </p>
           

            <h3>Prototyping and Wireframing</h3>
            <p>
                Use tools like Figma to create high-fidelity prototypes and wireframes. These can help visualize the design and layout before diving into development.
            </p>

            <h3>User Research and Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Conduct user research to understand your audience's needs and preferences. Implement usability testing to gather feedback on your designs and make iterative improvements.
            </p>
            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Ensure your application is accessible to users with disabilities. Follow guidelines such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to make your designs inclusive.</p>
            <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
            <p>Design with performance in mind. Optimize images, leverage lazy loading, and consider the impact of your design choices on load times and responsiveness.</p>
            <h3>Collaboration and Communication</h3>
            <p>Use collaboration tools like Slack, or Jira to coordinate with your team. Clear communication and documentation can help align your design with development and other stakeholders.</p>
            <h3>Version Control</h3>
            <p>If you're not already, consider using version control systems like Git to manage changes in your design files and coordinate with the development team</p>
            <h3>Responsive and Adaptive Design</h3>
            <p>Ensure that your designs work well on various devices and screen sizes. Test your designs on different devices and orientations to guarantee a seamless experience</p>
